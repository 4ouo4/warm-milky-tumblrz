            <p id="pfp-description">
                the tumblr page i used to go to right after coming home from school. 
                the comfort i would feel from the look of the page and posts. 
                the little music bar on the bottom playing music that would sooth not only my ears but the heavy weight in my chest. 
                i long to find that page again. 
                but if i can't find it, then i will re-create it.
